# credit-risk-analysis
Credit risk analysis using SQL and Python: performed data cleaning, manipulation, and visualizations with SQL and Matplotlib. Key insights and risk factors were presented interactively in a Power BI dashboard to support smarter loan approval and financial decision-making.


## Project Overview
This project evaluates the credit risk of loan applicants using a comprehensive approach. Data cleaning and manipulation were performed using SQL to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data transformation efficiently. Python’s Matplotlib library was used to visualize key relationships and patterns within the data.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with SQL
- Data manipulation and feature engineering
